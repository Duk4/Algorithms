Nathan loves cycling. <br>
Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling. <br>
You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

### For example:

time = 3 ----> litres = 1 <br>
time = 6.7---> litres = 3 <br>
time = 11.8--> litres = 5

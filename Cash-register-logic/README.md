# Cash-register-logic
You start with 0 in your cashregister. <br>
There is an array of x number of costumers. <br>
As costumers come to the ticket office they bring an array of numbers(bills). <br>
Ticket price is 70. Bills available to pay the price are: 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500.<br>
If clerk doesn't have enough bills to give you change, he'll tell you right away. <br>
If he has, he'll then tell you that instead. <br>
<br>
This could be case specific, but with little changes you can make it work in all cases.
